Hi, I’m [Will Kirkpatrick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/w-kirkpatrick/) — deep tech investor at Braavos, chess obsessive, and real tennis amateur. I’ve finally decided to start a blog as we roll into 2025.

Why? Because I'm interested to hear what people think. Plus, there’s nothing like public critique to keep you humble, so please, have at it.

Expect thoughts on quantum computing, climate tech, and other regions of 'deep tech'. No chess analysis, F1 commentary, or denim origin stories — though, believe me, it’s tempting.

Thanks for dropping by. Let’s dive into the deep end.
