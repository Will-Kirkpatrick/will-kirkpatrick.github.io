Hi, I’m [Will Kirkpatrick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/w-kirkpatrick/) — deep tech investor at Braavos, chess obsessive, and real tennis amateur. As we roll into 2025 I’ve finally decided to start a blog.

Why? Because I'm interested to hear what people think. Plus, there’s nothing like public critique to keep you humble, so please, have at it.

Expect thoughts on quantum computing, climate tech, and other areas of 'deep tech'. No chess analysis, F1 commentary, or denim origin stories — though, believe me, it’s tempting.

Thanks for dropping by. Let’s dive into the deep end.
